            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            Welcome to Cronix, a timer built on the principles of simplicity and modality.Along with a beautiful UI, Cronix has been designed from the ground up to help you focus on your solves and to help you get the best times.This is a comprehensive guide to all of the features in Cronix, organized into various sections.Feel free to skim through everything and come back if you need help with a specific feature.Alternatively, because of Cronix&apos;s focus on UX, feel free to jump right into the timer.
            <h2> The Cronix Mindset</h2>
            When using Cronix, put yourself into the mindset that timing is completely separate from analyzing your times.This might be difficult at first, but will help you better focus on the real task at hand: solving.The only statistics available to you on the main page by default is the current mo3, ao5, and ao12.If you want to, however, you may choose to add in the Time List via Cronix Widgets.
            <h2> Cronix Design</h2>
            Cronix is designed so that what you need at the moment appears when you need it.Judging controls appear after a solve.Specific widgets you set per session appear when you enter that session.Surrounding information disappears when you do solves.The dynamic nature of this UI is what makes Cronix special.
