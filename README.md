# Cronix

> It's time, for the future.

###

Introducing a timer that has been re-thought and re-built from the ground up. A beautiful design, with a clean, simple interface, made to focus on _your solves_.

Completely open-source, and open to suggestions!

### Inspiration

Inspired by Monkeytype's UI and VIM (and various other editors') modal usage, I have created a timer that has never been seen before. Find more links about how and why I developed Cronix in the `More Information` section.
